This project comes from the need to have the computers in my college lab to shutdown at a certain time. However, this time is not equal to all computers, and may change in some days, due to different schedules, so this time is to be found at a server, which upon query answers simply "yes", if the computer should be shutdown, or "not" if shouldn't.

As the project is originally in portuguese, it awaits for "sim", which means "yes", and "nao", which means "not".

It has a C# program for windows and a perl script for linux.
